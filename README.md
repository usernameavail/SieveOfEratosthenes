# SieveOfEratosthenes

This is a simple object oriented project that allows the user to input a number. The program stores the number, and will print a list of prime numbers up to the number entered when asked by the user using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. 

The user can also check if any number they want is prime using a separate menu option.
